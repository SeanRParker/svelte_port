<h1>Welcome to my portfolio site</h1>

<p>Discovering my love for web development in college, I made the transition from journalist to full time coder in 2012. As you can see by my resum√®, I've worked with startups, corporate, and public contracts since then.</p>

<p>I'm a team player who quickly picks up on how your organization works together, and a self starter who independently gets things done.</p>
