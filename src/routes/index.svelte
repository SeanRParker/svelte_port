<h1>Welcome to my portfolio site</h1>

<p>
  Discovering my love for web development in college, I made the transition from
  journalist to full time coder in 2012. As you can see by my resum√®, I've
  worked with startups, corporate, and public contracts since then.
</p>

<p>
  I'm a team player who quickly picks up on how your organization works
  together, and a self starter who independently gets things done.
