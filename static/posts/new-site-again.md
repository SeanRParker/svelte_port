title: New site! again!

First it was WordPress, then React. I decided I wanted something more lightweight with a blog feature. So I looked at JAMstack of a Vue flavor (like Gridsome). It still felt too heavy for what I was looking for.

I had heard of Svelte, but I kind of ignored it because of new framework fatigue. Then I learned Svelte is less a framework and more a bare bones compiler. I was sold. 

It's only been a day or so but the pickup has been pretty good, especially paired with Netlify for deployment (markdown support in a blog has been on my list of personal site requirements for a while).

I'm still trying to trackdown SCSS support but at the moment most of my other "business requirements" have been met.

This [tutorial](https://dev.to/avcohen/svelte-sapper-netlify-cms-3mn8) was especially helpful.
