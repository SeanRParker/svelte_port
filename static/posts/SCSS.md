slug: SCSS
title: SCSS integration with Sapper

Although there are [starter templates](https://github.com/markoboy/svelte-webpack-babel-scss) specifically built for this I implemented this by hand following this [guide](https://medium.com/@sean_27490/svelte-sapper-with-sass-271fff662da9).

Rollup is better supported in this framework than webpack, so don't be like I was at first by stubbornly trying to use webpack.
